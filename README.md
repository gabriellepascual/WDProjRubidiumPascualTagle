# Q3 Proposal Update

## Stardust Performers
### The website will serve as a gateway for the general public and new ONCES. Everything you need to know about TWICE will be in this website.

## Features:
1. Users will be able to access and explore the albums by clicking on them.
2. The website would be flexible for all users of different devices.
3. Users should sign up in our website to access mini quizzes and be part of the leaderboard.

## Details:
1. As the user clicks on the album, the album will play a snippet of its title track. It will play when the user clicks on the album cover.
2. Containers shall adjust to the dimensions of the device. With this, it'll be easier for the user when using our website.
3. The website will use HTML forms when a user is signing up and it will be stored in a local storage. This will be used for the leader board in our website.

# Definition of Done
Our website is considered done when it satisfies both our users and us by meeting its purpose, working properly, and providing a good user experience. Websites are never completely perfect and may still have minor bugs, but as long as the site is stable, usable, and continues to be visited by users, we consider it complete for its current version.
