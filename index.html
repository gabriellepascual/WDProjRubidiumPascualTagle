        <p>
            This website serves as a guide for new ONCEs who are interested in getting to know the girls better.
            After 10 years together, one can easily follow their journey as a nine-member girl group through this
            website. Additionally, it showcases their artistry and identity as a group through their music.
            TWICE's talents should never go unnoticed—their ability to compose, write, and produce their own songs
            is truly remarkable. This website stands as an honor to them, celebrating their achievement of lasting
            10 years as a nine-member group, filled with passion and love for what they do.
